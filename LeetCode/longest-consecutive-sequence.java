/*
We are given an unsorted array of integers. And we are asked to return the longest
consecutive elements sequence. 
 ~ Algorithm Must run in O(n) time.

I tried to solve with hashMap but it was still passing O(N), so looked up the logic for a 
faster solution, and found the set start solution. 

It is so smart and Since it is O(n) + o(n), total time complexity is â‰… O(N).
